# VR Science Lab with Realistic Physics

## Overview
Welcome to the **VR Science Lab**, a virtual science lab environment where students can conduct experiments with realistic physics interactions, such as fluid dynamics, object collisions, and force simulations. This project leverages **Unity** for development and **NVIDIA PhysX** for realistic physics, with optimization support from **NVIDIA Nsight Graphics** and **NVIDIA Nsight Systems**. The result is a high-performance, immersive VR experience tailored for educational applications.

### Key Features
- **Realistic Physics Interactions**: Simulate real-world physics in VR, enabling students to explore concepts like gravity, friction, and fluid dynamics.
- **Optimized Performance**: Profiled and fine-tuned with NVIDIA Nsight tools for smooth rendering and low latency, even during physics-heavy simulations.
- **Interactive Modules**: Students can engage with experiments, manipulate lab equipment, and observe real-time effects without frame drops.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Unity** (2020 or newer): Install Unity to create, run, and test the VR Science Lab.
- **NVIDIA Nsight Graphics** and **Nsight Systems**: Download from [NVIDIA Developer Tools](https://developer.nvidia.com/tools-overview) to profile and optimize the project.
- **VR Headset** (optional): For a full VR experience, connect a compatible headset (Oculus, HTC Vive, etc.) during testing.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/VR-Science-Lab.git
   cd VR-Science-Lab
   ```
2. **Open in Unity**:
   - Launch Unity and select **Open Project**.
   - Choose the `VR-Science-Lab` folder to load the project.
3. **Configure NVIDIA Nsight**:
   - Refer to `Documentation/SetupInstructions.md` for Nsight setup and usage instructions.

## Running the Project
1. Open a scene from `Assets/PhysicsLabScenes/`.
2. Run the project in Unity to test in-editor or build the project for standalone VR deployment.
3. Use **Nsight Graphics** and **Nsight Systems** for profiling:
   - Launch Nsight, select the built project, and start profiling to monitor GPU usage, frame rates, and performance metrics.

## Development Goals
- **Module 1: Basic Physics Concepts** – Gravity, friction, and object manipulation.
- **Module 2: Fluid Dynamics** – Real-time fluid simulations with optimized rendering.
- **Module 3: Force and Collision** – Experiment with different force applications and observe collisions.

## Optimization and Performance
Optimization is key to creating a smooth VR experience. The following steps are recommended for developers:
- **Profiling with Nsight Graphics**: Use this tool to analyze the rendering pipeline, detect bottlenecks, and fine-tune graphics settings.
- **CPU/GPU Load Management with Nsight Systems**: Profile CPU and GPU usage to identify and resolve performance issues in physics-heavy scenes.
- **Performance Documentation**: Refer to `Documentation/PerformanceOptimizations.md` for profiling results and optimization adjustments.
